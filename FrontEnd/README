Run 'make' to construct the executable 'CreateASTandIR'.

Run './createASTandIR testfile' to perform lexical, syntax and semantic analysis
(lex and yacc) and to generate LLVM IR from the AST.

Testfiles lie in the 'Testing' directory.

Run 'clang main.c resultingIR.ll' to generate an executable made from this IR.

In generating the IR and in some instances in yacc, memory has not been thoroughly
freed.
